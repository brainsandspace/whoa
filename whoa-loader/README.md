# whoa-loader üéÜ-üîÑ

Webpack loader for .whoa files.

> Read [the intro blog posts]()

## The problem
I started making a blog built on custom React components, and I was having a lot of fun with it, but it wasn't that easy to read with all the JSX, making editing not fun. Don't get me wrong, I think JSX is great, but it ain't got nothing on the readability of Markdown files. I wanted to be able to write Markdown-like markup for my custom components.

## This solution
I built this loader on top of this extensive Markdown processing ecosystem called [remark](https://github.com/wooorm/remark) made by this dude [wooorm](https://github.com/wooorm). Definitely check that out, because he has put tons of work into making an easily extensible system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
- My regexes are naive, and I don't really know what I'm doing here. Things are broken, and I am fixing them as needed. Feel free to help though.

## Local development
