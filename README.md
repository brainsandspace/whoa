# whoa ðŸŽ†

This repository contains three distinct parts of the whoa project.

1. `whoa-loader`
  A webpack loader for `.whoah` files
1. `whoa-theme`
  A Visual Studio Code theme extension for writing whoa.
1. `whoa-language-support`
  A Visual Studio Code language extension that makes colorizing and other niceties in `.whoa` files work.

To use `whoa-theme` and `whoa-language-support` locally, you need to put them in your `.vscode` folder. I haven't yet been able to get symlinks to this folder working, which is annoying.
